        <h1> Who we are and Our Story</h1>
        <div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding w3-medium w3-text-dark-grey ">
<p>We are a group of three friends who have collectively decided to abandon our corporate jobs to share our homes and
            just enjoy life. <br><br>
            Actually, John and I (Aubrey) are happily married and Jacob is just the third wheel we could never get rid of,
            just kidding! All three of us have been friends since childhood and bonded over our shared love for food!<br><br>
            If you have questions about where we bought our furniture, or any home decor item, feel free to ask John. He knows 
            all the best places locally and the best sources. This is mostly due to his weird obession with HGTV and I guess his
            12+ years as a buyer for a major home decor company. <br><br>
            If you're more interested in trying great local food but don't want to risk getting sick, then don't call Jacob. 
            Ask me (Aubrey) instead! However, if you somehow need to know where the 24 hour pharmacy is, defintely ask Jacob. 
            If you're nice, he might even tell you where he stashed the tumeric ginger tea where you're staying at (pro-tip: probably 
            not in the cupboard right above the kettle, he likes to keep things high because he's super tall.) <br><br>

            Feel Free to ask us questions before and during your stay! We are so happy to share our homes with you and hope you have a great adventure!
            <br><br><br>
        Much Love, 
        <br><br>
        John, Jacob and Aubrey
